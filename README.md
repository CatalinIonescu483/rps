A simple Rock Paper Scissors Game. 

Thanks to former student with git username artkol for posting the solution which helped me figure out a good method for determining the result of each round.

The live version of the original (console) version of the game can be found at www.mikkelceramics.com/rps.html
It was supposed to be played from the console, but I chose to use alert boxes and prompts, as I found that to be easy to implement and more user-friendly.




The live version of the updated (buttons) version of the game can be found at www.mikkelceramics.com/rps2/
